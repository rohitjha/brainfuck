.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIbf\fP is an interpreter for the Brainfuck programming language. Written in C, it can take Brainfuck programs as input in the form of files or directly as a sequence of operators, passed as argument, and return the results to the standard output.

.PP
.TP
.BI \-F
\-\-filter [\fIFilename\fR]
Read \fIFilename\fR and remove every character expect '<', '>', '+', '-', '[' and ']' and print the result to the standard output. ("< <>> ++ - [-]" is translated to "<<>>++-[-]")

.BI \-b
\-\-balance [\fIFilename\fR]
Read \fIFilename\fR and balance '<', '>', '+' and '-' characters. ("++++--" is balanced as "++" and so on)
.SH EXAMPLES
1. Running a Brainfuck program, stored in a file:
        To run the Hello World! example, which is available as 'hello_world.bf' in the examples directory, run the following line:

        $ bf -f examples/hello_world.bf

        Which gives the output "Hello World!" (without quotes).

2. Passing a sequence of Brainfuck operators directly to the interpreter:
        To execute a set of operations, such as >>+++. (which prints the content of the third cell after incrementing the existing value by three), run the 'bf' program as:

        $ bf -e '>>+++.'

3. Displaying help:
        $ bf -h

4. Running a program and then obtaining contents of tape
cells:
        Run a program, as shown in either case 1 or case 2, with the only change being the addition of a '-t' option:

        $ bf -f examples/hello_world.bf -t 10

        This will display the result and then print contents of the memory tape from cell 0 to cell 10.
